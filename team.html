  bio: As a humble hustler, I&#8217;ve grown with Austin Coding Academy over the last
    three years holding several roles wherever I could add value to the school and
    to the students. I graduated with a Journalism BS from University of Richmond
    (go Spiders!), and got my professional start with sales and leadership. I&#8217;ve
    traveled coast-to-coast on my motorcycle several times, which led me to find a
    true home here in Austin in 2014. I&#8217;m all about connecting, so say hello!
