# NEW in 2019: Unlimited Tutoring for All Students

![](/assets/Dinh.png)

At Austin Coding Academy, we take pride in providing our students an unmatched level of support and community. From our tutors and TA's providing in-class support to getting together for monthly happy hours, ACA is a tight-knit community of students, instructors, graduates, and a team who's passionate about working together.

One element of student support that we're most proud of piloting in 2018 is unlimited tutoring to all of our students. We're excited to announce that in 2019 every student at Austin Coding Academy will have unlimited access to our network of tutors. We think it's important that we provide this for a few reasons:

##### Learning to Code is Challenging

Gaining all the skills necessary to become a web developer isn't easy. Most of our students start from square one or with limited exposure to coding which is why it's so important for us to provide continuous academic support to our students as they go through our program. We don't want to be just another coding bootcamp that churns out students who aren't fully prepared for real-world jobs.

##### **If You Make the Time + Financial Investment, We Want to Make Sure You Succeed**

No one should struggle in silence. We firmly believe that anyone can become a web developer if they're willing to put in the work. That means that as long as our students are completing their work, looking for help when they get stuck, and seeking out solutions – we want to make sure that the help they need is available to them.

##### **Our Tutors Want to Give Back**

Our tutors are graduates of our program that have gone on to get jobs in the industry and are looking to share their knowledge and experience with current students. We think this is great for a few reasons. First, it builds a community and a culture of giving back. Second, having a role model who has been through the same coursework and process and gone on to become a developer is a huge asset to our students. Finally, our tutors are developers currently working in the field. They know what it takes to be successful in the industry and how to push our students to find the same success.

##### **Student Success is Our First Priority**

Our number one goal is for every student that takes classes at Austin Coding Academy to land a job as a web developer when they graduate from our program. That means more than just providing classes. We make sure that our curriculum is always up-to-date with industry standards, that we provide all of our graduating students with a free job placement course, and now we make sure that all of our students have access to tutoring. All of this support is crucial in making sure that our students not only make the grade, but that they go on to be successful in their new careers.

If you're considering a career in coding, don't hesitate to fill out our quick application right now. Doing so will get you on the path to having all the conversations necessary to see if this is a good fit for you and doesn't force you into any obligations with us.
