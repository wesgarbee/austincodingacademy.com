It's a great time for job placement at Austin Coding Academy! Tech in Austin is booming and at ACA we're not only focused on giving our students the best possible coding education, but also to provide our students all of the skills necessary to be successful developers when they leave our program.

Here are six of our graduates who have landed or have already started in full-time developer roles in recent months! We couldn't be more proud of the hard work that they've put in to get to this point. Check them out:

Not only are our grads landing jobs, but we're more committed than ever to make sure that every grad who leaves our program is job-ready. Our first ever Job Placement Course wrapped up a few weeks ago. The course is 4 weeks long and free to all graduates of our program. Led by Edsel Rivera, a Technical Recruiter at Dosh, the course covered everything from building a resume and LinkedIn presence to whiteboarding and technical interviews. You can [learn more](https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/qa-with-our-new-job-placement-director-edsel-rivera) about the Job Placement course, which is now a permanent part of the ACA curriculum, here.
