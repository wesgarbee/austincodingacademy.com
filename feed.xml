But what if you want to speed things up a little? When it comes to getting a job as a developer, you may not want to wait years to get started. Good news: there are some things you can do in your spare time every day that will help you get better in less time. Here are five things to try to learn programming faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-practice-every-day-on-real-projects&quot;&gt;1. Practice every day on real projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any other job, having hands-on experience is a must. Whether it’s for your own personal website, or a project for a close friend or family member, try to find actual assignments to give yourself for practice. When you get to flex your coding muscles on things that will actually live on the internet, you put yourself into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/how-the-principles-of-language-learning-can-help-you-code-better&quot;&gt;immersive environment&lt;/a&gt;, giving you a better chance to become fluent quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-use-free-coding-websites-for-tutorials-and-projects&quot;&gt;2. Use free coding websites for tutorials and projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for aspiring developers, there is no shortage of resources online these days. Using platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;CodeAcademy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/&quot;&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://agupieware.com/&quot;&gt;aGupieWare&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeavengers.com/&quot;&gt;Code Avengers&lt;/a&gt;, you can access free tutorials and cool project prompts. On any of these sites, you’ll work on interactive platform, learning languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and Python to create web apps, games, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-make-and-use-flashcards&quot;&gt;3. Make and use flashcards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can handle the flashbacks to high school, go old-school and use flashcards! In the same way they helped you master vocabulary words for the SAT, flashcards can help you learn common terms for whatever coding language you’re trying to master. They’re also portable, meaning you can break them out at breakfast, on the bus to work, or when you need a five-minute break from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have index cards handy, hate your handwriting, or are just too embarrassed to be seen holding flash cards in public, you can also use an app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flashcards+-by-chegg-free/id408490162?mt=8&quot;&gt;Flashcards+&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/studyblue/id323887414&quot;&gt;StudyBlue&lt;/a&gt; to get the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-blog-about-it&quot;&gt;4. Blog about it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to put new knowledge to the test is to try to explain it to someone else. Consider creating a personal blog to help you document your journey to becoming a masterful developer. In addition to serving as a great reminder of how far you’ve come, blogging about what you’re learning helps cement new concepts so they can connect to the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, it can also be a great way to network. By connecting with other developers, whether they’re more or less experienced than you, you have the opportunity to share what you’ve learned and take advantage of the knowledge of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a great writer? You may want to consider recording yourself and creating a vlog to share your learnings in video form instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-take-a-class-or-coding-bootcamp&quot;&gt;5. Take a class or coding bootcamp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootcamps and classes are another excellent way to learn programming faster. Classes are instructor-led, allowing students to get hands-on experience and work directly with professors. Taking a front end or back end track class through a program like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.austincodingacademy.com/&quot;&gt;Austin Coding Academy&lt;/a&gt; takes students through the beginning, intermediate, and advanced lessons necessary to prepare for full time developer roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing with your organization, changing careers, or getting serious about a hobby all starts with mastering the subject matter. If you’re a programmer or a future programmer in the Austin area, we’d love to talk to you about how our 10-week courses can help you transition into a career as a developer or sharpen your existing skills. &lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/apply/&quot;&gt;Learn more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Mastering a new skill can take years of focus and practice.

Your portfolio is more than a showcase of projects and work samples. Your portfolio is your digital space that invites hiring managers to learn more about you and how you would be a great fit in their company and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes a great developer portfolio? What are hiring managers looking for when they review one? Let’s take a closer look at the important elements that make up a solid developer portfolio that will land you an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started-now&quot;&gt;Get started now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your developer portfolio is an ongoing, evolving project. Don’t wait until you start sending out your resume to start developing your portfolio. Get started as soon as possible so you’re not rushing to get something together before a recruiter takes a look. If you’re still taking classes, add projects to your portfolio as you complete them. Then, continue to update and improve your portfolio with every project you work on or goal you meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-your-skills&quot;&gt;Show your skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the cornerstone of your portfolio. Not every hiring manager is the same. Some may look at your resume first before moving to your portfolio. Others may want to follow a link to your hosted projects or your Github repository of projects. It’s important that you keep up with each of these elements, so no matter the method of the hiring manager, you’re prepared to show off your work, skills, and technological capabilities and how you solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t spend too much time trying to build the next great app that does a new thing or solves a different problem but ends up being poorly ‘spec’ed out. You may end up burdened by the amount of decisions and get stalled in your project. Your portfolio doesn’t need to be limited to work someone else commissioned or paid you to do. Find a project or app to clone and show a hiring manager how you would solve the problems with that app to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Colten, Chief Technology Officer and Lead Instructor at Austin Coding Academy, says he looks for “a strict following of coding conventions that can span different coding languages, especially if I’m considering hiring them in a language that isn’t their preferred language.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of role and breadth of technologies used, hiring managers often look for the following skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;front-end&quot;&gt;Front-end&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different DOM manipulation technologies (Document API, jQuery)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JSON and AJAX requests (current with libraries and frameworks with a willingness to continue learning.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML5 and basic understanding of accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS feature support and organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backend&quot;&gt;Backend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Model-View-Controller architecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic SQL and NoSQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RESTful API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While education and experience is important, don’t forget to show off any ways you’ve been self-taught too. Include any repositories built from tutorials, a developer blog, or completed massive open online courses (MOOC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-a-story&quot;&gt;Tell a story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of ‘telling a story’ has become ubiquitous in fields like design and branding. We hear it so often it’s nearly lost its meaning. Yet, there is some fundamental importance to telling a story—it’s something we as humans connect with at our core. Displaying your skills and abilities through storytelling is the best way to make that connection and display your value. Every story has the same basic elements: characters and conflict. Your portfolio tells the story about you, the character, and your journey to overcome certain challenges through your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t include sketches and ideation just for the purpose of including artifacts — make sure that they support the story in some way, and demonstrate your creativity in solving the problem,”&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/design-ibm/design-portfolio-tips-and-tricks-from-a-hiring-manager-9bc42e7fcde7&quot;&gt; says Gord Davidson&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Design and Studio Manager at IBM Studios Toronto. Davidson has many years of experience working with and hiring designers. He believes every portfolio should follow this storytelling theme—each in its own way, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-for-the-hiring-manager&quot;&gt;Design for the hiring manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examine your portfolio from the hiring manager’s perspective. They are sorting through dozens of portfolios in a sitting—what will make yours stand out? Do you create a cohesive, memorable experience for the hiring manager, from your cover letter to resume to portfolio? Do you answer questions the hiring manager is asking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you adding something to your portfolio, ask, “Does this contribute to the story I’m telling about my work skills and experience?” If the information you’re adding doesn’t highlight your work, skills, and who you are as an employee, leave it out. Don’t do have the worst portfolio ever. Be sure your portfolio does address these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What problem did you solve?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How did you get to the final product?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which tools did you use to get there?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What challenges did you overcome to reach this?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What purpose did this serve for the client?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to answer these questions in your portfolio in a concise manner. Keep the projects you display relevant to the role you’re applying. It needs to be memorable, but it also needs to be something they actually look at. You can always have more project examples or case studies available during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-wait-to-get-paid&quot;&gt;Don’t wait to get paid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a new developer, you’re probably wondering: how do I show off my experience when I haven’t had a job yet? Remember, no one has to pay you to do a job for it to go in your portfolio. Show off your own work you’ve done for fun, do some pro bono work for a local organization, or show off your skills by ‘cloning’ an existing project. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel and come up with your own startup idea. Try redesigning a major brand’s website as if they hired you. Rebuild an existing app, but make it better by showing how you would solve some specific problem areas in the app and make the program flow better. Don’t be afraid to experiment! This shows hiring managers you can identify and solve problems creatively even without a project brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ACA, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/courses/&quot;&gt;build a project every day of class&lt;/a&gt;, and some bigger projects may take several sessions. From there, students can show off their work online or continue building on a project. We also provide our students with updates about freelance and volunteer opportunities to work on projects to help build out their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apply-early-and-often&quot;&gt;Apply early and often&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, the biggest hurdle in landing that first job is not the portfolio, experience, or interview skills—it’s the lack of applications job seekers submit. They also tend to delay too long before submitting those applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We cannot stress enough that it’s the sheer number of applications [students] submit to different companies that will get them hired. It should not be uncommon to have 50+ applications out at a time because it surely isn’t uncommon to only hear back from five percent,” says Kevin. “It sounds stressful, but most anxiety experienced by students is the rush they feel to have their portfolio perfect when they should be more concerned with getting those first interviews, knowing that they may even bomb the first few.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tech industry, the interviewing process can take several weeks for one company. You may not hear back from many companies for a while or at all. The more you jobs you apply for, and the earlier you start the process, the better your chances of getting that interview, and ultimately, the job.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you’re just starting out on your path as a developer without much or any experience to show off in your portfolio, the road ahead may seem daunting.

Between the high job security, exciting work culture, competitive pay, and (in some cases) extremely generous and creative perks, tech companies make an excellent case for learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one common concern we hear at Austin Coding Academy from students and prospective students is this: “I work in the service industry and I don’t have any technical job experience. Will anyone even hire me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an understandable concern. After all, when you’re not working in the tech industry currently, it’s tough to get a handle on what the hiring landscape looks like. The good news is that tech companies and startups are regularly looking for people with coding skills, whether they’ve been at it for a few months or a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course your skills will become more developed (and more valuable to employers when it comes to salary negotiations) over years of working. Still, the absence of technical work on your resume should not scare you away or hold you back from getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin Coding Academy students have all kinds of work backgrounds. Many people come to us looking to move away from their service industry jobs as servers, baristas, bartenders, hairdressers, etc. At first glance, it may not seem like these jobs have anything at all to do with working as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, service industry jobs and other non-technical work experiences build a broad range of soft skills that may serve you well in a technical position, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communication-skills&quot;&gt;Communication skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of strong communication skills in any corporate environment cannot be overstated. Regularly checking in to make sure that all stakeholders are up to speed on the status of a project—including expected completion dates, roadblocks you encounter along the way, and any number of other relevant concerns— is the mark of a professional, competent developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, strong communication skills are also necessary to function successfully in any service industry job as well. Whether you realize it or not, when you work in a fast-paced and demanding client-facing position (such as retail or food service), you develop and sharpen this skill set. The ability to communicate the status of orders with coworkers and customers in a timely fashion is a good indicator of how well you’d be able to use the same skills in an office setting..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resourcefulness&quot;&gt;Resourcefulness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even seasoned developers will occasionally run into an issue with their code that they’ve never encountered before. Understandably, this experience is even more common for beginners. That’s why it’s so important for developers to be resourceful thinkers. Being able to identify and draw from the resources that are available to you (whether that’s the advice of a more experienced team member or help from fellow developers on a Stack Exchange forum) is another mark of a strong contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also happens to be another skill that workers in the service industry can develop and strengthen on the job. Servers, baristas, and retail workers routinely have to get creative and find ways to meet customers’ high expectations on a tight timeline, using only the tools that are readily available to them. These experiences can translate into a smoother career transition than many of our students initially expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a hairdresser accidentally makes a bigger cut than they meant to, there’s no going back. When a bartender pours the wrong drink, or a server brings out an incorrect food order, those resources often go to waste, and customers are likely to become irritable. People in service industry jobs learn quickly— often through early mistakes— how important it is to focus and get things right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, strong developers know how pay attention to small details. When the difference between success and failure can come down to a handful of characters on a screen, having the ability to focus is crucial. Since experience is usually the best teacher, people with service industry backgrounds often have this skill down to a science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-soft-skills-are-more-important-than-you-think&quot;&gt;Your soft skills are more important than you think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication, focus, and resourcefulness are just a few of the soft skills that people in the service industry learn on the job. There are many other crucial traits these jobs can nurture, such as social skills, timeliness, and work ethic, to name a few. All these skills can help create a successful move into a technical position, even if your work experience doesn’t seem relevant at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently working in the service industry or another non-technical position, it’s understandable to feel intimidated by the thought of moving into a technical role. The truth is, though, that these job experiences may help make you a stronger developer down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft skills you’ve picked up in your past work experiences may actually make you a desirable job candidate and a more successful, productive employee in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As the Austin tech scene continues to appeal to job seekers and people looking to switch careers, one common concern is: “I work in the service industry and I don’t have any technical job experience.

&lt;p&gt;Web Development is an all encompassing term that focuses on the development of websites and web applications. Jobs may include web-based internet applications, social networking platforms, and electronic business platforms. Individuals trained in this field may work in web content development, web engineering, cyber security, or design. This training could also lead to the development of CRM systems, still considered a new branch of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day an age, virtually every business and individual contractor needs a website and payment platform to operate. This means more jobs for individuals like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Growth&lt;/strong&gt;: “The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm&quot;&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt; projects about 13 percent employment growth for web developers by 2026. During that period, about &lt;strong&gt;21,300 new jobs&lt;/strong&gt; will need to be filled in an industry that already &lt;strong&gt;has roughly 162,900 positions&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Developer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Web developers&lt;/strong&gt;, also called &lt;strong&gt;web&lt;/strong&gt; designers or webmasters, design and maintain websites. You might design and develop basic website layout or advanced interactive website features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Web&lt;/strong&gt; application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development. &lt;strong&gt;Web engineering&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the specifics of application development that apply to websites and their offsets.&lt;/p&gt;

What will your first year’s salary be? How will your salary change throughout your career? What factors will contribute the most to your compensation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how much money you can expect to earn working as a web developer and how experience, education, location, and coding specialty can all impact your salary. Knowing what your skill is worth will help you negotiate better pay as you advance through your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-impact-of-experience-on-your-salary&quot;&gt;The Impact of Experience on Your Salary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in any other job, more experience as a developer will often lead to higher pay. Perfecting your craft means you can work on more meaningful projects and require less supervision from managers. Here’s how your salary will change as you move throughout your career:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-job-little-to-no-experience&quot;&gt;First Job (little to no experience)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding students are often very interested in their first job’s salary because they’ve worked so hard to earn it. In an entry-level job title like junior programmer or software developer, a first-year developer will earn a $64k average salary (ranging from $58k to $77k). This is consistent with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/austin-coding-academy&quot;&gt;ACA’s average graduate salary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experienced-5-years&quot;&gt;Experienced (5 years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With five years of experience, you will have mastered many of your day-to-day tasks. Increased efficiency means you can advance to positions such as a senior developer or lead software engineer. At this point, you can expect to earn an average of $80k per year, ranging from $69k to $100k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mid-career-6-14-years&quot;&gt;Mid-Career (6-14 years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-career, many developers will move to managerial roles and away from technical ones. These roles will require you to know how to manage people, sell clients, oversee projects, analyze results, and plan for future initiatives. Average salaries for these positions are usually over $100k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;late-career-15-years&quot;&gt;Late Career (15+ years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in a developer’s career, they may have climbed the corporate ladder into positions like software development manager, vice president of information technology, or even chief information officer (CIO). Salaries for these positions range between $120k to $170k. You can increase your salary even more by starting your own company or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/highest-paying-jobs-at-google&quot;&gt;working for a tech giant&lt;/a&gt; like Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-factors-affecting-salary&quot;&gt;Other factors affecting salary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schooling&quot;&gt;Schooling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does education have a big impact on your salary? It can. It will depend on how useful your new skills are and how much time you’re required to invest before you start work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common options for coding education are either a&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/computer-science-degree-vs.-austin-coding-academy-which-is-the-best-choice-for-aspiring-developers&quot;&gt; coding bootcamp or a computer science degree&lt;/a&gt;. Bootcamp graduates tend to learn more in-demand skills and can, therefore, earn &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bloc.io/comparing-salaries-for-coding-bootcamps-vs-computer-science-degrees/&quot;&gt;$6,000 more&lt;/a&gt; than degree holding developers on average. Most companies are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.indeed.com/2017/05/02/what-employers-think-about-coding-bootcamp/&quot;&gt;just as likely to hire&lt;/a&gt; bootcamp graduates as they are college graduates. Hiring manager&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.triplebyte.com/bootcamps-vs-college&quot;&gt; Ammon Bartram writes&lt;/a&gt;, “All in all, we’ve had roughly equivalent success working with the two groups.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major difference between bootcamps and bachelor’s degrees is the time they take to complete. ACA’s bootcamp, for example, takes only nine months, compared to four years for the typical bachelor’s degree. With three additional years of working experience, you’ll learn a lot of skills on the job, giving you a strong competitive advantage over people who got a four-year degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you work will have a large impact on your salary. For example, coders in California can &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.co/much-software-developer-make-every-state-2015-03&quot;&gt;earn 83% more&lt;/a&gt; than coders in North Dakota, but that high salary won’t go as far in California as it would in a less-expensive state. Be careful to consider cost of living into your decision-making process when choosing where you want to live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, developers in Austin will earn a $79k salary. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151132.htm&quot;&gt;occupation wage chart&lt;/a&gt; can help you compare the average Texan developer’s salary and cost of living to those of their counterparts working in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coding-specialty&quot;&gt;Coding Specialty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coding languages you learn could affect your job title and income. Use a tool like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/&quot;&gt;TIOBE index&lt;/a&gt; to research the market demand for different coding languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACA teaches its students JavaScript and C# because these languages will give graduates a large salary and in-demand skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure which skills would be the best fit for your goals, here’s an article we’ve written to help you &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/which-aca-track-is-right-for-you&quot;&gt;decide which coding track is the right choice for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

What does a typical day look like? How much money can I expect to make? What do I need to learn before I can apply for a position?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you’re looking online or who you’re talking to, you may have picked up that many developers have a bachelor’s degree (or higher) in computer science. In fact, until recently, a CS degree was the most direct path into a career in code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while many people working as developers have degrees in computer science, that doesn’t mean it’s a requirement. In fact, as the cost of college continues to rise with every passing year, there are fewer people who are willing or able to sink that kind of money (or time) into getting a degree. Meanwhile, the demand for capable developers hasn’t slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where coding schools (like Austin Coding Academy) come into the picture. As more and more developers are needed to build the technology we depend on every day, and with fewer people able to press pause on their lives for four years, coding schools offer a way to get smart, motivated people up to speed so that they can enter the booming tech workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a job as a developer, you could opt for an expensive four-year education— including a bunch of random classes that have nothing to do with learning to code— or you could enroll in a coding school and get your coding career started sooner. Here’s why a coding school (like Austin Coding Academy) is a better option for people who want to become developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-life-friendly-schedule&quot;&gt;More Life-Friendly Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students enrolled in a four-year degree program are generally unable to get their education while also holding down a full-time job. Between unusual course schedules, group projects, and study time for a wide variety of courses, most full-time college students can’t also be full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students in coding schools like Austin Coding Academy, on the other hand, are able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/how-to-manage-time-effectively-when-you-dont-have-much-of-it&quot;&gt;continue working in their full-time jobs while taking classes in the evenings&lt;/a&gt;. Many ACA students have said that this factor gave them the peace of mind and financial flexibility to take the leap. In just two nights a week, ACA students get the education they need to transition out of their current day jobs and into their dream careers as full-time developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;smaller-class-sizes&quot;&gt;Smaller Class Sizes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most four-year universities, students are required to take numerous prerequisite courses before they get to start learning any of the practical knowledge they’ll need in the working world. These entry-level classes are big money-makers for universities, since they can pack huge groups of students into a lecture hall with one professor. In these environments, there’s often very little (if any) personal interaction between the instructor and most of the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Austin Coding Academy, there isn’t a long list of prerequisite coursework to do before jumping in; there’s just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; introductory course, and it has a limited class size just like our intermediate and advanced courses. We believe in keeping our classes small— a maximum of 20 students— so that each student is able to get individualized attention when they hit a snag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, these smaller class sizes mean our students get a chance to know and build friendships with their classmates. The result is a warm, positive environment where fellow students and instructors serve as a support network to encourage each other when the going gets tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lower-cost&quot;&gt;Lower Cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a single year at a four-year university is enough to give most people a serious case of sticker shock. According to The College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees per year ranges from $9,410 at a public school (for in-state students) all the way up to a whopping $32,410 for private schools. These figures don’t include living expenses, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our goals at Austin Coding Academy is to provide the best value and return on investment for our students. That means keeping our class prices accessible to hard-working, motivated students, and it’s why we provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/tuition/&quot;&gt;affordable tuition&lt;/a&gt;— with no opaque fees tacked on top. Our students know exactly what they’re paying for: a high-quality, useful coding education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;professors-with-real-world-experience&quot;&gt;Professors with Real-World Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academia operates with its own antiquated rules, meaning that most university professors are &lt;em&gt;professors&lt;/em&gt; by trade. When students get a computer science degree, they’re likely to be taught by instructors who haven’t worked as developer recently— if ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, every Austin Coding Academy instructor is currently employed in the tech industry. Because of this, they’re able to adapt their instruction to reflect what’s happening in the industry at the moment. Even better: their students get to learn from people who know exactly what practical skills they’ll rely on to do their jobs every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;commitment-to-getting-you-a-job&quot;&gt;Commitment to Getting You a Job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of a four-year college education, students are rewarded with a diploma that proves they’ve taken the required coursework to graduate. This piece of paper may or may not help them get a job in their chosen field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of an ACA education, sure, there’s a certificate. But more importantly, our students leave with a professional network, an impressive portfolio demonstrating their new skills, and the support of our well-connected staff to help them find a job as a developer shortly after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/get-to-know-aca-graduate-stephanie-singler&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent ACA graduate Stephanie had multiple job offers within a month of graduation— listen to her experience in her own words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Austin Coding Academy, we’re committed to providing the best possible return on our students’ investments. When students enroll at ACA to get on the path to their dream jobs, we’re with them every step of the way— from the first class through to a new career (and beyond).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we make it a priority to help our graduates find high-paying jobs in the tech industry as soon as they finish their ACA coursework. We’re able to do this through the connections our former students, instructors, and other staff maintain with movers and shakers (and hiring managers) all over the tech industry in Austin. Our former students are currently working as JavaScript developers, full stack developers, QA engineers, and project managers, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-aca-the-right-fit-for-you&quot;&gt;Is ACA the Right Fit for You?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to make a career change to get into a challenging, exciting, dynamic role in the tech sector, it’s important to remember that a computer science degree is not the only way to get there. An Austin Coding Academy education can get you the same results in less time, for less money, and without the risk involved in quitting your full-time job to enroll in school. Our knowledgeable and supportive staff will ensure that your coursework reflects what’s needed in the real world right now, so you can be sure that you’ve got the most in-demand skills in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everybody deserves access to a technical education and an opportunity to benefit from Austin’s booming tech industry,” says Austin Coding Academy CEO, Chris Lofton. “We’re excited to partner with Lyft to provide their drivers with this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin Coding Academy (ACA) will provide a discount to all current Lyft drivers who are interested in launching a career in technology. Currently, ACA offers tracks in Javascript, C#/.NET, and UI/UX and each track consists of three courses. Lyft drivers will be eligible for $225 off a single course or $675 off the total track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tapping into a growing, but at times exclusive, tech scene, ACA is constantly looking for opportunities to foster inclusivity and diversity in tech through key program features such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part-time courses aimed at allowing working adults to continue to support themselves while making a meaningful career change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most affordable full stack web development tuition in Austin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A curriculum that is researched, designed, and taught by local, full-time industry professionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving accessibility to drivers who have already demonstrated a commitment to using their spare time to better support themselves represents another step towards promoting diversity of experience and identity – and one that has already seen success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean Philippi has excelled as a student at ACA, where he’s on track to graduate as a full-stack Javascript developer in December of this year. As a Lyft driver and now an ACA student, Sean embodies the extra level of commitment necessary to thrive in a challenging environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Untitled%20design%20(31)-890896-edited.png&quot; alt=&quot;sean-philippi&quot; title=&quot;Sean Philippi, Lyft driver &amp;amp; ACA student&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Sean Philippi, Lyft driver &amp;amp; ACA student&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When self-teaching in the past, I’d often give up after being stuck for so long. I still get stuck now, but I have people that can help me get unstuck quickly, which is one of the most valuable parts of being in a classroom,” Sean says. “I find the courses to be well-paced and challenging. I am very grateful for having discovered ACA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACA is excited to provide Lyft drivers with the opportunity to develop skills and transition to higher-paying tech jobs. With part-time evening courses and the most affordable full-stack coding education in the area, Austin Coding Academy is committed to increasing local access to careers in tech. ACA graduates work at companies like Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, Verizon and many Austin Startups.&lt;/p&gt;

Websites like Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube give us an endless supply of content that are often more engaging than the tasks we need to accomplish. But focus is crucial for developers; one misplaced character in thousands of lines of code can throw off an entire project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once you lose focus, getting it back is a challenge. In fact, studies show that when people get distracted, it can take up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.idonethis.com/distractions-at-work/&quot;&gt;25 minutes to refocus&lt;/a&gt; on the task they had been working on. If you have five distractions per day, you’re essentially wasting two hours of productivity time. Most of us can’t afford to lose that kind of time when work deadlines are approaching, so here are some actionable tips to help develop focus and get more done at work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-one-thing-at-a-time&quot;&gt;Do one thing at a time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can feel like there’s an infinite amount of things we “should” be working on, which often causes people to panic and rush into a flurry of multitasking. But multitasking is actually counterproductive, because rapidly switching between tasks means none of them get your full effort. Working like this isn’t just overwhelming; it effectively &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2014/10/08/multitasking-damages-your-brain-and-career-new-studies-suggest/#4ccca28356ee&quot;&gt;decreases your IQ&lt;/a&gt; by 15 points!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train yourself to do one task at a time by getting rid of distractions and focusing 100% on the one task you’re are working on. It can be tempting to try to juggle multiple tasks, but by training yourself not to, you’ll produce higher quality work and feel less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prioritize-important-tasks-first&quot;&gt;Prioritize important tasks first&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx&quot;&gt;scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; and books like &lt;em&gt;Willpower&lt;/em&gt; suggest humans have a limited amount of willpower they can exert each day. You spend a little bit of your willpower reserve each moment you’re focusing on a task. When you run low on willpower, you become less focused, give less effort and are more likely to give up on tasks. To use your daily willpower efficiently, schedule the most important tasks of the day first. This will give you best chance of actually completing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important tasks may include things like making diagrams, writing code, and analyzing software outputs. Low-priority tasks might include checking email, surfing the internet, and chatting with coworkers. Save low priority tasks for the end of the day, when your willpower is gone and you’re getting ready to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good way to prioritize tasks for the day is to do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/impact-vs-effort-analysis-productivity&quot;&gt;impact vs. effort analysis&lt;/a&gt;. The goal here is to accomplish tasks that are high impact but low effort first to gain small wins and build momentum. Then do high impact high effort tasks. Finally, move to the low impact activities near the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;schedule-blocks-of-time&quot;&gt;Schedule blocks of time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicating blocks of time to certain tasks allows you to focus on one task without worrying that you won’t get to any of the hundred other tasks fighting for your attention. Uninterrupted work time helps you maintain focus and get tasks done faster than you would have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple time-blocking strategy you can use is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730&quot;&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;. With this technique, you set a timer to 25 minutes and dedicate 100% of that time towards working on one individual task. 25 minutes is intended to be long enough to be effective but short enough to be achievable. When the 25-minute timer is up you take a break (usually for 5 minutes) and then continue to the next 25-minute block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-rid-of-distractions&quot;&gt;Get rid of distractions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every device we own has apps and websites competing for our precious attention, but we don’t have to let them win. Keeping yourself free from distractions allows you to focus on getting more work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell phones are a huge distraction for most people. Eliminate them by turning off your phone, or choose not to bring it to work (if you can). If this isn’t realistic for you because you have family who may need to contact you during the day, try to encourage family and friends to communicate with you via email during the workday, except for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your computer can be another distractions minefield. Reduce interruptions by turning off email notifications and pings from messaging platforms like Slack or Facebook Messenger. Use chrome extensions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en&quot;&gt;Stayfocusd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en&quot;&gt;News Feed Eradicator for FB&lt;/a&gt; to help restrict access to distracting websites. If you find yourself often coming up with creative ideas for other projects while you’re working, quickly jot them down with apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://laterbox.co/&quot;&gt;Laterbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/docs/about/&quot;&gt;Google docs&lt;/a&gt; so you can get back to work quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-your-workspace-free-of-clutter&quot;&gt;Keep your workspace free of clutter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of clutter and simplifying your workspace is another crucial tool to help you reduce distractions and focus on your work. Decide which objects absolutely need to be there for you to get your work done, and take everything else home or throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just apply to your desk, either; your computer may have clutter that distracts you from getting work done. Remove all unnecessary icons, clear up the files on your desktop, and close applications and tabs when not using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-finishing&quot;&gt;Start finishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common to juggle many projects all at once and still feel like you’re not getting anything done. To combat this, you may want to start the day by finishing tasks you’ve already started. Look at your to-do list and decide which tasks can/should be finished first. Then focus all your efforts on getting these critical tasks done, one at a time. Checking off tasks will make you feel more accomplished, and it’ll make your to-do list less daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many programmers use project management systems like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilelearninglabs.com/resources/scrum-introduction/&quot;&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2hDKpgzdIE&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; to make managing work tasks easier. This can be done with sticky notes, or with software like &lt;a href=&quot;http://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;. However you choose to go about it, display all the tasks you’re working on in one location, and move tasks from “in progress” to “done” as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-get-enough-sleep&quot;&gt;Bonus: Get enough sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people try to burn the midnight oil to be more productive. But de-prioritizing sleep does more harm than good. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/these-sleep-habits-can-make-you-better-at-your-job&quot;&gt;Adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; helps to improve attention, working memory, and overall happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers are exposed to blue light from computers and phone screens all day. Blue light activates a photoreactive cell in your eyes which tells your hippocampus to block the release of sleep hormones like melatonin. Without these sleep hormones, it’s much more difficult fall asleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to prevent this problem is by trying to avoid looking at screens at night. You can also use apps and filters to reduce the amount of blue light your devices emit. iPhones have an app called Night Shift, and Androids have settings like eye comfort and blue light filter. Schedule your screen to be “warm” or show you less blue light as you get closer to bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-to-improve-your-focus&quot;&gt;Time to improve your focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, it’s important to be efficient at your work. Not only does that make you faster when working on your own projects, it makes you more marketable to employers. Developing focus will let you work to your full potential instead of getting distracted and wasting time switching tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Glitch: Coding Made Easy” is a 2-hour workshop whose goal is to inspire teens to explore careers in computer programming. We are proud to partner with APL to introduce a creative an in-demand skill for their future careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the students began the night with no coding experience, but after 120 minutes, all were able to create and deploy their own websites on a topic they were interested in. “We covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,” said ACA’s CEO Chris Lofton, who instructed the class. “One student built her website about books and movies she loves. Another student’s website consisted of pictures from all the places she traveled. One even built a site that included instructions on how to play his favorite video game!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;![Teenage student builds website displaying places she’s traveled](https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_9845.jpg?width=595&amp;amp;name=IMG_9845.jpg =595x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course, students worked together to solve different problems they encountered while building their sites. Each of the students was fully engaged through the process of brainstorming, designing, and building their pages while getting feedback and guidance from their instructor. By the end of the night, they each had an active website to take home and continue building on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We could not be any happier with the event,” said APL Youth Technology Librarian Adrian Perez. “One particular student, Tori, attended the program we had the next night and told me that she always wanted to major in music, but after Glitch and joining a robotics club last month, she wants to go into coding as well – specifically music software. She proudly told us that she already knows what she wants to do with her life – and she’s only 13!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on Austin Public Library’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.austintexas.gov/events/calendar?loc=3939&quot;&gt;events calendar&lt;/a&gt; for more Austin Coding Academy library workshops coming down the pipeline. It is ACA’s core mission to make tech careers accessible to everyone, and we think giving teens exposure to the challenges and rewards of coding will illuminate this as a possible path they could take after high school. “We absolutely want to continue planning events with ACA in the future,” said Perez.&lt;/p&gt;

Should I take an online class, an in-person class, or a remote class? And what language or specialty should I invest my time in learning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Austin Coding Academy, we currently offer two separate tracks for our students: JavaScript and C# .NET. We believe that there isn’t one “best” option; the right choice for each student has everything to do with their personal goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll take a closer look at both tracks, including general salary ranges, career outlooks, online communities, and job titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caution-dontonlyconsider-salary-and-hiring-outlook&quot;&gt;Caution: Don’t &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; consider salary and hiring outlook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to lean heavily on salary data when choosing a coding language or specialty. But since your career takes up most of your waking hours, it’s important to consider which one will be most personally fulfilling and interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at salary data on websites like Glassdoor and Payscale, you may notice a huge range of possible salaries. This is because, even with the same job title, there can be a lot of variation in job responsibilities and seniority. The best way to increase your salary potential is to be a key player on whatever team you end up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s so important to choose a track you’re passionate about; your interest in your work will give you the motivation to go above and beyond what’s asked and expected of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-comparisons&quot;&gt;Track Comparisons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s take a look at the two tracks offered at ACA, starting with JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/javascript/&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript (JS) is one of the most common coding languages, with about a third of software development jobs requiring some JavaScript knowledge. It’s also a relatively easy language to learn and has one of the largest communities to reach out to. The main purpose of JavaScript is to manipulate objects; any time something moves on a website, JavaScript is probably involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a giant in the internet browser world. It works across all the most popular web browsers and phone apps because it uses variables to adapt its code to the platform. Coders use JS in applications like Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and IOS/Android app platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s mostly an advantage, the cross-platform adaptability of JS can sometimes lead to compatibility issues. Because JavaScript is error-prone, proficient developers will have an easy time finding a job. Companies will even pay freelancers to double-check their JavaScript code through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/&quot;&gt;bug bounty programs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;salary&quot;&gt;Salary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range: $51k - $120k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average: $75k - $100k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Average: $60k - $70k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;job-outlook&quot;&gt;Job outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job outlook for Javascript is strong. By 2020, there will be over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-programming-is-a-trade-lets-act-like-it-1407109947&quot;&gt;one million unfilled Javascript positions&lt;/a&gt;. Developer jobs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm&quot;&gt;projected to increase by 24%&lt;/a&gt; over the next 10 years— much higher than the 10% average in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has one of the largest Overstack communities, and is the most tagged language in GitHub. You will have no problem finding resources or connecting with other working coders with such a sizable community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;example-job-titles&quot;&gt;Example job titles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full-stack website developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;App developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Website admin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JavaScript consultant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality assurance automation specialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/csharp/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C# is an open-source Microsoft programming language. It’s a high-level language, which means it can handle a lot of the nitty-gritty technical stuff for you. Since C# is “static,” much of the code is explicit and clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This static nature of C# makes it easy to understand at a glance, and is why it’s the go-to choice for projects that need consistency, simplicity, and scale. C# is also a fast language to run, which makes it a great candidate for programming video games through the Unity engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If developing games or consistent code snippets sounds appealing to you, C# may be a good choice. It’s also certain to provide you with robust job opportunities and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;salary-1&quot;&gt;Salary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range: $45k - $120k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average: $70k - $95k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting: $60k - $70k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;job-outlook-1&quot;&gt;Job outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer students choose to learn C# compared to JavaScript ,even though the projected growth rates are about the same (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm&quot;&gt;24%&lt;/a&gt;). This slight saturation of the JavaScript job market might lead to higher salaries for C# programmers in the next few years. C# also has interesting growth opportunity in the virtual-reality (VR) game market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;community-1&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C# community is not quite as active as JavaScript, but it’s still the 4th largest on Overstack and the 7th largest meetup community. The Microsoft brand also provides many resources to help developers master the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;example-job-titles-1&quot;&gt;Example job titles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full-stack web developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows app developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information security specialist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C#.net developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database manager&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unreal developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-transferrable-skills&quot;&gt;Learn transferrable skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tracks provide the foundational knowledge and transferrable skills for amazing web design. A working knowledge of C# will aid you in picking up JavaScript, and vice versa. UX designers’ great understanding of design principles helps make them effective website designers with even basic coding knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interdisciplinary skills will help you impress hiring managers and improve your value when you start working with your new team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-these-resources-to-help-you-decide&quot;&gt;Use these resources to help you decide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking in all this information can feel like drinking water from a firehose. A great next step in your research process is to speak with real-life developers already in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some resources to connect you with working programmers:&lt;/p&gt;
